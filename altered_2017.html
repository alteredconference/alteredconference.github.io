          Crisis, Like Never Before
        </h2>

        <h3><center>
          We're happy to officially announce Altered Conference 2017!
        </center></h3>

        <p>
          The world is roiling - that is nothing new - but like never
          before each of us are forced to watch it unravel in gory detail via
          mass media, social networking and the internet.
        </p>

        <h4 class='theme-font-2017'><center>
          That's the good news.
        </center></h4>

        <p>
          Like never before we are connected to each other and therefore, like
          never before, we are affected by each other.  This deep sympathetic
          relationship has always been there, but with increased awareness so
          too does its power increase.
        </p>

        <p>
          The world is in crisis like never before but we can alter our
          relationship to it, and to each other, and instead of crisis, see opportunity.
          Things are unstable, but it means <strong>change is possible like
          never before</strong>.

          <blockquote>
            The crisis of modern society is precisely that the youth no longer
            feel heroic in the plan for action that their culture has set up.
            They don’t believe it is empirically true to the problems of their
            lives and times. We are living a crisis of heroism that reaches into
            every aspect of our social life: the dropouts of university heroism,
            of business and career heroism, of political-action heroism; the
            rise of anti-heroes...
            </br>
            The great perplexity of our time, the churning of our age, is that
            the youth have sensed — for better or for worse — a great
            social-historical truth: that just as there are useless
            self-sacrifices in unjust wars, so too is there an ignoble heroics
            of whole societies: it can be the viciously destructive heroics of
            Hitler’s Germany or the plain debasing and silly heroics of the
            acquisition and display of consumer goods, the piling up of money
            and privileges that now characterizes whole ways of life...
