          <h3>A conference exploring altered states of consciousness</h3>
          <h2>
            November 2017</br>
            Berlin</br>
          </h2>

        <h3><center>
          Altered States, Crisis and Opportunity
        </center></h3>

        <p>
          The world is roiling - that is nothing new - but like never
          before each of us are forced to watch it unravel in gory detail via
          mass media, social networking and the internet.
        </p>

        <p>
          Like never before we are connected to each other and therefore, like
          never before, we are affected by each other.  This deep sympathetic
          relationship has always been there, but as we are faced each day with
          the highs and lows of the global community, it is becoming
          increasingly tangible.
        </p>

        <p>
          At Altered 2017 we want to <strong>explore crisis and our relationship 
          to it</strong> as individuals and as communities, both local and 
          global.
        </p>

        <p>
          What new perspectives can altered states of consciousness reveal?</br>  
          How can those perspectives reflect back on the 'real' world?</br>  
          How can we use altered states to see opportunity where once we saw only 
          crisis?</br>
         <strong>
          How can we integrate those perspectives into our lives and our 
          communities?  
        </strong></p>

        <h3 class='theme-font-2017'>Objectives</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>

          </li>
          <li>
            To create an open atmosphere to discover, share and consider our

            To provide access to stimulating workshops, rituals and lectures

            collaborations
          </li>
          <li>
            To build a landing zone - a place where the dreams we encounter in
            altered states can be invoked and given the energy required to manifest
          </li>

          <blockquote>
            You are an explorer, and you represent our species, and the
            greatest good you can do is to bring back a new idea, because our
            world is endangered by the absence of good ideas. Our world is in
            crisis because of the absence of consciousness.

          <blockquote>
            The great perplexity of our time, the churning of our age, is that
            the youth have sensed — for better or for worse — a great
            social-historical truth: that just as there are useless
            self-sacrifices in unjust wars, so too is there an ignoble heroics
            of whole societies: it can be the viciously destructive heroics of
            Hitler’s Germany or the plain debasing and silly heroics of the
            acquisition and display of consumer goods, the piling up of money
            and privileges that now characterizes whole ways of life...
