          Crisis, Like Never Before
        </h2>

        <h3><center>
          We're happy to officially announce Altered Conference 2017!
        </center></h3>

        <p>
          The call for papers is open and we are accepting proposals for talks
          and workshops surrounding altered states of consciousness,
          specifically those related to this year's theme of
          <strong>crisis</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          The world is roiling - that is nothing new - but like never
          before each of us are forced to watch it unravel in gory detail via
          mass media, social networking and the internet.
        </p>

        <p>
          Like never before we are connected to each other and therefore, like
          never before, we are affected by each other.  This deep sympathetic
          relationship has always been there, but with increased awareness so
          too does its power increase.
        </p>

        <p>
          The world is in crisis like never before but we can alter our
          relationship to it, and to each other, and instead of crisis, see opportunity.
          Things are unstable, but it means <strong>change is possible like
          never before</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>

        <h3>Inpiration</h3>
        <p>
          For me, personally, this has been the most crisis-filled year of my
          life - and when I look around me, I see many, if not most, of the people in
          my life going through crises of their own. Big, small, it doesn't
          matter - there's a beautiful quote from Viktor Frankl that comes to mind:

          <blockquote>
            ...suffering is similar to the behavior of gas.  If a certain quantity
            of gas is pumped into an empty chamber, it will fill the chamber
            completely and evenly, no matter how big the chamber.  Thus suffering
            completely fills the human soul and conscious mind, no matter whether
            the suffering is great or little.
          </blockquote>
        </p>

        <p>
          It's easy to get lost in the fog, to wander in circles, to give up.
          I've seen the people around me struggling, but like never before I've
          seen people facing their struggles, accepting their fears, digging in
          and fighting hard. Not giving in, not taking the easy way out. I've
          been inspired by the people who stop ignoring problems, who suffer
          consciously, and accept that suffering as the true joy of life.
        </p>
